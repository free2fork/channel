# Time series analysis of SOI

The Southern Oscillation Index \(SOI\) is a standardized index based on the observed sea level pressure differences between Tahiti and Darwin, Australia. The SOI is one measure of the large-scale fluctuations in air pressure occurring between the western and eastern tropical Pacific \(i.e., the state of the Southern Oscillation\) during El Niño and La Niña episodes.

### Objective

Use the dataset provided to create a time series analysis of SOI using same basic criteria\(formulas, data\) as the official.
